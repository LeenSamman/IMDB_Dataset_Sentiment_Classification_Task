            "5068 brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues of leopold bloom, stephen dedalus, and molly bloom by joseph strick in recreating the endearing portrait of dublin on june 16, 1904 - bloomsday - a day to be celebrated - double entendre intended! bravo director strick, screenwriter haines, as well as casting director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece. gunter grass' novel, the tin drum filmed by volker schlöndorff (1979)is another fine film adaptation of interior monologue which i favorably compare with strick's film.while there are clearly recognized dublin landmarks in the original novel and in the film, there are also recognizable characters, although with different names in the novel. for example, buck mulligan with whom dedalus lives turns out to be a then prominent dublin surgeon. this film for all of its excellence is made even richer by additional viewings. brian invinoveritas1@aol.com 15 june 2008\n",
